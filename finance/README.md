# Finance stack
The finance stack is just firefly iii, docs and install guides are [here](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/firefly-iii/installation/docker/). The APP_KEY env strin which firefly uses for hashes is added manually in portainer as an env var. The string is stored in the repo as a github secret. Same for the database usename and password.
